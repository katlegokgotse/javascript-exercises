Exercise 1: Numbers

1. Declare a number variable and assign an integer to it. Declare a variable
   and assign it a floating number.
2. Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus and
   exponentiation with a number variable and another number.
3. Print all your variables.
   Exercise 2: Boolean and Operators
4. Use comparison operators to compare two numbers and store the results
   in boolean variables.
5. Declare two variables x and y with the values 8 and 12 respectively.
   a. Use comparison operators to check and print the following:
   b. If x is greater than y.
   c. If x is less than or equal to y.
   d. If x is equal to y.
   e. If x is not equal to y.
6. Declare the variables a and b with values true and false, determine and print
   the result of the following logical operations:
   a. a AND b
   b. a OR b
   c. NOT a
7. Declare variable p and assign it a value of 10. Use the following
   assignment operators to modify the value of p with any number and print
   the result each time:
   a. +=
   b. -=
   c. \*=
   d. /=
   e. %=

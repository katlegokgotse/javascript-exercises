# Data Types & Operators

## Exercise 1: Numbers

1. Declare a number variable and assign an integer to it. Then, declare another variable and assign it a floating-point number.
2. Perform the following operations using the number variables:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division
   - Modulus
   - Exponentiation
3. Print all your variables.

## Exercise 2: Boolean and Operators

4. Use comparison operators to compare two numbers and store the results in boolean variables.
5. Declare two variables `x` and `y` with the values `8` and `12`, respectively. Perform and print the results of the following comparisons:
   - Check if `x` is greater than `y`.
   - Check if `x` is less than or equal to `y`.
   - Check if `x` is equal to `y`.
   - Check if `x` is not equal to `y`.
6. Declare two variables `a` and `b` with values `true` and `false`. Determine and print the results of the following logical operations:
   - `a AND b`
   - `a OR b`
   - `NOT a`
7. Declare a variable `p` and assign it a value of `10`. Use the following assignment operators to modify the value of `p` with any number and print the result each time:
   - `+=`
   - `-=`
   - `*=`
   - `/=`
   - `%=`

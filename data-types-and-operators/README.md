# Data Types & Operators

## Exercise 1: Numbers

1. Declare a number variable and assign an integer to it. Declare another variable and assign it a floating-point number.
2. Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation with a number variable and another number.
3. Print all your variables.

## Exercise 2: Boolean and Operators

4. Use comparison operators to compare two numbers and store the results in boolean variables.
5. Declare two variables `x` and `y` with the values 8 and 12 respectively:
   - Use comparison operators to check and print the following:
     a. If `x` is greater than `y`.
     b. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`.
     c. If `x` is equal to `y`.
     d. If `x` is not equal to `y`.
6. Declare the variables `a` and `b` with values `true` and `false`. Determine and print the result of the following logical operations:
   - `a AND b`
   - `a OR b`
   - `NOT a`
7. Declare a variable `p` and assign it a value of 10. Use the following assignment operators to modify the value of `p` with any number and print the result each time:
   - `+=`
   - `-=`
   - `*=`
   - `/=`
   - `%=`
